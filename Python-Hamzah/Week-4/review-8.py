8. Onoki ordered shinobi to gather materials in preparation for the Fourth Great Ninja War. 
He ordered half of his platoon to gather 478 bulks of iron and the other half to obtain 9821 
pieces of silver. Each bulk of iron contains a dozen pieces of iron. How many material pieces 
did they manage to obtain in total? Please write your code in the review-8.py file. NOTE: You 
may not use one print statement for your entire solution. You must implement the solution in 
the way we have reviewed.
